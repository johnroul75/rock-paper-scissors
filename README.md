# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first Javascript project. It is a Rock Paper Scissors console project. I know a small basic skillset in terms of javascript. I believe I will be using functions, variables, loops, and conditional statements mainly. I have not gone over any clean code lessons yet so I anticipate that my code will be messier.

I read that this will be played from the console and we will revisit the project adn add a GUI after.
